## Flashcard Server
A simple json-server made using a template to serve my flashcard app static site.
Flashcard-App: https://github.com/James-Lycett/Flashcard-App

I have since created an API to connect the flashcard app to a database so saved data persists between sessions.


The API can be found deployed here: https://flashcard-app-backend-b1x2.onrender.com

The static site can be found deployed here: https://flashcards-weld.vercel.app/
